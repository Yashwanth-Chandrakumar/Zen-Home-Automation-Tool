## Usage

The standard Alexa voice commands for turning on, turning off, and dimming lights can be used for devices exposed via HALE. Sadly some voice commands are far less reliable than others and this is a problem on the Alexa voice processing side and nothing HALE has control over. The most reliable forms from my testing seems to be "Alexa, Turn On <foo>" and "Alexa, Turn Off <foo>".
